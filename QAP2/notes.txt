1.	How many hours did it take you to complete this assessment? (Please keep try to keep track of how many hours you have spent working on each individual part of this assessment as best you can - an estimation is fine; we just want a rough idea.)
Answer:
This took about 16 hours. I had to take some breaks in between questions to review previous classes and practice questions so that time is also involved.

2.	What online resources you have used? (My lectures, YouTube, Stack overflow etc.)
Answer: I used previous lectures, prsactice questions, w3 schools, your YouTube and the links provided.

3.	Did you need to ask any of your friends in solving the problems. (If yes, please mention name of the friend. They must be amongst your class fellows.)
Answer: I did not ask for help but Stpehen Fennelly and I did keep in contact about generally where we were in the QAP.

4.	Did you need to ask questions to any of your instructors? If so, how many questions did you ask (or how many help sessions did you require)?
Answer: I did not.

5.	Rate (subjectively) the difficulty of Making this all! from your own perspective, and whether you feel confident that you can solve a similar but different problem requiring some of the same techniques in the future now that youâ€™ve completed this one.
Answer: Similar to QAP 1 I would rate it a higher difficulty at the start and by the end I would rate it a medium difficulty, which leads me to belive I need to practice even more. I doo feel confident in using these in the future but this QAP will become a reference for myself in the future as I well need to review some of the newer things learnt to remember.
